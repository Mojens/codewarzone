          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Mohammad, and welcome to my website, where aspiring programmers can practice and hone their skills in various programming languages.</p>
          <p>As a student at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology), I have a strong passion for programming and a deep understanding of the challenges faced by students learning to code. This led me to work as a programming tutor, helping others navigate the complex world of JavaScript, Java, Spring, MySQL, Maven, and more.</p>
          <p>I am currently expanding my expertise by learning Python, Swift, and Android development, and I have a vision for this website to eventually support exercises for all of these languages.</p>
          <p>My goal is to make learning different programming languages enjoyable and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.</p>
